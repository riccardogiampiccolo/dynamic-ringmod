## Functionality

The MATLAB code includes various functions allowing users to select different methods for solving diodes. Users can explore and choose among these functions for their specific requirements.
The Python implementation, instead, makes use just of the Newton-Raphson solver.

## Files

The repository includes the following main files:

- `dynamic_RingModulator_SIM.m`: Main MATLAB script for the dynamic ring modulator implementation. It implements the Scattering Iterative Method (SIM) proposed in Ref. 1, and used in Ref. 2 to address the simulation of the dynamic ring modulator.
- `lib/DiodeWrightOmega.m`: MATLAB function implementing a solver for diodes using the Wright Omega function, as shown in Ref. 3.
- `lib/FastWrightOmega.m`: MATLAB function implementing the fast approximation of the Wright Omega function proposed in Ref. 4.
- `lib/LambertW.m`: MATLAB function implementing the iterative solve proposed in Ref. 5 for evaluating the Lambert W function.
- `lib/diodeNRsolver.m`: MATLAB functions for solving diodes using a Newton-Rapshon solver, as shown in Ref. 1, 2.
- `LTspice/dynamic_RingModulator.asc`: LTspice schematic of the dynamic ring modulator. You can download the freeware software at this [link](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html). Both Windows and macOS are available.
- `LTspice/ltspice_Vout.txt`: File containing the output voltage points obtained within LTspice. Such a file is used as ground-truth.
- `python/dynamic_RingModulator.py`: Python script for the dynamic ring modulator implementation. It implements SIM and just the Newton-Raphson method for solving diodes.

## Usage

To utilize this code, clone the repository and execute `dynamic_RingModulator_SIM.m` in MATLAB or `python/dynamic_RingModulator.py` within a Python IDE. Choose a different diode solver function within `dynamic_RingModulator_SIM.m` to experiment with different methods.
